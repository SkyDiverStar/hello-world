#Why do we need versioning for the Cocoa App

>Before getting to the when and how, letâ€™s start with why. My main aims are that:
- Everyone should know what features are available in the version of the app they have
- Everyone should know what version of the app they have if they are reporting bugs or requesting support
When I say everyone, I mean anyone who uses your app, including internal testers, beta testers and end users.
